## Course Description  
This course is about preparing, visualizing, reporting, and presenting different types of data, their distributions, and their relationships. We will begin by creating common plots (e.g., bar charts, histograms, density plots, boxplots, time series, scatterplots, and lattice plots), and then move on to visualizing results from statistical models such as linear or logistic regression models, including uncertainty representation.

The primary tool for visualization will be the `ggplot2` library in R, which we will use for static graphics. We will then move on to `plotly` for creating interactive graphs that include mouse-over and click events. Later, we will use R’s `shiny` and `DT` libraries to build and publish interactive web apps and dashboards that allow data exploration, sorting, and filtering. The course will culminate in creating multi-graph or map web apps that respond to user inputs or display real-time data streams.

Throughout the course, you will use GitHub for version control to organize and track your code and visualization projects.
